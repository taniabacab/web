Memories follow me left and right<br>
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here<br>
You take up every corner of my mind (what you gon' do now?)<br>
Ever since the d-day y-you went away (no, I don't know how)<br>
<p></p>
How to erase your body from out my brain (what you gon' do now?)<br>
Maybe I should just focus on me instead (but all I think about)<br>
Are the nights we were tangled up in your bed<br>
<p></p>
Oh no (oh no)<br>
Oh no (oh no)<br>
You're goin' 'round in circles<br>
Got you stuck up in my head, yeah<br>
<p></p>

You take up every corner of my mind (what you gon' do now?)<br>
Ever since the d-day y-you went away (someone tell me how)<br>
How much more do I gotta drink for the pain (what you gon' do now?)<br>
You did things to me that I just can't forget (now all I think about)<br>
Are the nights we were tangled up in your bed<br>

Every time I close my eyes?<br>
